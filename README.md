# ts-koa-passport-mongo-boilerplate

## DEPRECATED

I don't really recommend using Mongo, and am not able to thoroughly test the
Passport integrations since I don't have accounts on most social media sites.
Use if you like, but I won't be updating this.

Auth microservice boilerplate.

TypeScript, Passport, Koa.

To get up and running:

```shell
git clone
cd auth
npm ci
npm start
# build; runs tests
npm run build
# test
npm t
# production server
node .
```

Includes examples for Google CloudBuild, CircleCI, Docker, and Kubernetes. Find and replace `foo` with the correct strings.
